# Sound-Synthesizer
Sound synthesizer written in C++ 

  Hello, this is a sound synthesizer that follows the OneLoneCoder tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgamhuQnOkM (parts 2, 3, and 4 can be found easily).

  This project is currently on pause while I brush up on my math and read more into DSP (Digital Signal Processing), as I find it very interesting. This is a long term project for me.

  In the meantime, enjoy what's here :)
